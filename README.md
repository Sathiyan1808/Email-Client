DESCRIPTION:
A software project comprising of a strongly built email client that allows users to send emails to any email address and at the same time allows to receive emails too. The email client uses SMTP and POP3 services to send and receive emails. Our software system allows users to compose emails as per user requirements along with title destination email and the message body. The email client composes of an inbox as well as spam folder for receiving emails. Emails consisting of content as per predefined rules (not overly populated with images and links) are saved in email inbox. Emails containing images or links above a certain limit are saved in the spam folder. Thus the emailing system provides a secure and advanced pop3/SMTP based client application. The system provides a robust understanding of an email client and allows for efficient sending and receiving of emails. Recurring emails are email messages that are supposed to be automatically sent, periodically, based on user defined settings.  A new email window will be displayed but unlike a regular email there will be additional options on the right side where you can define when the recurring email will be sent. The time intervals can be one of the following: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly (once at three months), yearly or custom. Besides the time interval you can set on which weekdays to send the recurring emails, what attachments to add (when those files are updated after the recurring email was setup) by using Attachment file sources button and when to stop sending the recurring email. After setting up the recipient(s), subject, email content and recurring email settings save the email and close it. The new recurring email will be listed in the manager window where you can check when it will be sent (Due date column), last time when it was sent (Last sent column) or its current status.
